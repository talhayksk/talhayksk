# 👋 Hello, I am working as a Software Developer.
<b>⚡ Although I mostly work in .Net and .Net Core environments, I am trying to learn current frameworks such as Angular, React Native and I love working.<br>
I add my own work and projects that I have done while learning as open source to my github account.
</b> <br>

<ul>
  <li> 🔭 <a href="https://openlayers.org"> I've just started learning openlayers</a> </li>
  <li>🌱 I continue to learn react native </li>
</ul>
